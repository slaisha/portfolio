 <a href='#' style="text-decoration:none"><b>About Me</b></a> -->

 I currently work as a data analyst for Honda. Previously, I attended CSUF where I earned my MS in Business Analytics and BA in Accounting & Information Systems / Decision Sciences.

 I am experienced in data analysis, machine learning and data visualization. The main tools I use are SQL, Python, Power BI and Tableau.

 Besides data storytelling, I also love to golf and lift weights. So if you ever want to bounce ideas off me, please feel free to [contact me](email:shainalolin@gmail.com).
